# Banking-Management-System
A secure banking application handling accounts, transactions, loans, and reports.

1. Project Overview

The Banking Management System is a software application developed to automate and manage basic banking operations in a simple and efficient manner. It provides a digital platform for customers to create accounts, perform transactions, and manage their banking activities securely. The system reduces manual work, improves accuracy, and ensures safe handling of customer and transaction data through a centralized database.


2. Problem Statement

Traditional banking processes involve manual record-keeping, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Managing customer accounts, transactions, and balances manually can lead to data inconsistencies, security issues, and delayed services. There is a need for an automated system that can efficiently handle banking operations while ensuring accuracy, security, and easy data retrieval.


3. Objectives

To design and develop a computerized banking system.
To automate basic banking operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer.
To provide secure user authentication and data storage.
To maintain accurate transaction records and account balances.
To reduce manual effort and improve operational efficiency.


4. Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Database: SQLite / MySQL
Frontend: Console-based interface (can be extended to GUI/Web)
Tools: Python IDLE / VS Code
Platform: Windows / Linux


5. How It Works

The user registers by providing basic details and creating a bank account.
The user logs in using a valid username and password.
After login, the system allows the user to perform operations such as deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry, and fund transfer.
Each transaction is recorded and stored in the database for future reference.
The system retrieves and updates account information in real time, ensuring accuracy and security.

7 day project plan:
